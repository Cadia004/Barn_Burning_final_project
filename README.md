# Barn_Burning_final_project

- visualization of the story "Barn Burning" by Haruki Murakami
- made by students of the University of Cologne as part of the event "Media Transformation"

- our idea was to present the short story as a never-ending cycle in which the protagonist is caught
- texts and images support the atmosphere
